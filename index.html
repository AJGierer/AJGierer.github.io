			<h2>What Does Andrew Know?</h2>
				<p>
				For starters, the website you're on, well I built it . . . from scratch.<br>
				Over the course of a few weeks, I spend bits of free time to learn HTML,
				CSS, and GitHub's Git protocol for hosting and repositories, then built this site for fun.

			<h2>What Has Andrew Done</h2>
				<p>
				When I moved to Boston, I intentionally lived as far away from the only
				two people I knew in the area. I wanted to put myself on an island and force
				myself to survive, knowing I'd be stronger for it.
